    Present the user with an even number of cards, “face down”.

    When the user clicks a card, “flip it over” and reveal the hidden image.

    When two cards are revealed:

        If the cards are identical, remove them from play.

        If they are not, flip them back.

    The game ends when all cards are removed.
